## Project Synopsis

The aim of the project is to implement a webpage almost entirely using DOM 
manipulation in JavaScript.

## Learning Objectives

Mostly this project is a collection of all the previous JavaScript work.  
- Almost complete implementation using JavaScript
- Webpack implementation
- As a personal goal a strong theme based implementation

## Outcome

I'm calling this one a bit earlier than I planned. I'm getting far too bogged 
down in the website creation aspect of this when I've completed the actual 
learning objectives. At the end of the day I've created a webpage where the 
content is managed entirely in JavaScript and I've had some fun with the menus.
